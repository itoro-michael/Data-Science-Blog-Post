# Write A Data Science Blog Post

This repository contains the Python codes used to analyse the 2019 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey dataset.
The analysis is used to support my blog post on Medium, titled "An Overview of Developers Working Remotely in the 
Stack Overflow Annual Survey for 2019". [Click here][1] to view the Medium post. 

## Project Motivation

More jobs are being advertised with the remote tag, which creates curiosity in the subject. 
This project reviews the different aspects of the remote working model as it relates to developers in 2019.
The questions the project seeks to answer are:

1. What is the ranking of countries based on their number of full-time remote developers?
2. What is the nature of the employment of full-time remote developers?
3. How does the average annual salary of full-time remote developers compare to the never remote camp?
4. What is the average age in the two groups?
5. What is the mean coding experience for both the full-time remote and non-remote developers?

## Libraries in the project 

Include: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, IPython.display, and textwrap.

## Files in the project besides the README:

1. Remote_Developers.ipynb: notebook file showing the analysis of the 2019 Survey.
2. Remote_Developers_2017.ipynb: notebook file showing the analysis of the 2017 Survey dataset.


## Conclusion: 

The results obtained show that the full-time remote developers are mostly the more experienced professionals, who are older,
with higher incomes on average, and they also have higher job satisfaction ratings, as compared to those who don't work remotely.
The results apply generally to the dataset without considering individual countries.
